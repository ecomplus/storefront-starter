[PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps) and
[JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/)
based e-commerce template for
[E-Com Plus](https://www.e-com.plus)
stores

## Getting started

To get started easily, you should have a
**[E-Com Plus](https://www.e-com.plus)** store,
then deploy your new e-commerce to
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Deploy to Netlify

To setup your new site on Netlify, we recommend choosing
**`dist` as _branch to deploy_ with no _build settings_**.

> You can also deploy from `master`
to take advantage of deploy previews, but using `dist` branch
you'll consume fewer build minutes on your Netlify plan.

#### The easier way

#### The better way

1. [Use this template](https://github.com/ecomclub/storefront/generate)
to generate a new repository for your store;
2. [Log in to Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) and
[create a _new site from Git_](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/#deploy-with-git)
choosing your generated repository;
3. [Enable Netlify Identify](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/identity/#enable-identity-in-the-ui),
add _invite users_ by email to administrate your storefront,
you may start adding your own email address;
4. [Enable Netlify Git Gateway](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/git-gateway/#setup-and-settings);

### Access CMS

Storefront comes with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)
for administration.

After your site is deployed, you should receive an invitation email
from Netlify to grant CMS access.
You must click the email link, then you should create
a new password on a pop-up opened on your new e-commerce homepage.

At the end of this process you'll be able to login to CMS
at `/admin/` URL using your e-mail and password.
